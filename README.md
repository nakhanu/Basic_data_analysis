# Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment

## Overview
This project involves loading and analyzing a dataset using the `pandas` library in Python and creating visualizations using the `matplotlib` library. The assignment covers data exploration, analysis, and the creation of simple plots to visualize trends and relationships within the data.

## Objectives
- Load and analyze a dataset using the `pandas` library.
- Create basic visualizations (line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to represent the data.
- Compute and analyze basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.
- Explore relationships between variables and identify trends in the data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this assignment contains information about sales data. It includes the following columns:
- **Product**: Name of the product.
- **Sales**: The sales figures for the product.
- **Region**: The region where the product was sold.
- **Date**: Date when the sale occurred.

## Steps Completed

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Loaded the dataset into a `pandas` DataFrame.
- Explored the data using `.head()` to display the first few rows.
- Checked for missing values and cleaned the data by handling them appropriately.

### 2. Basic Data Analysis
- Calculated basic statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).
- Grouped the data by the **Region** column to compute the mean sales for each region.

### 3. Data Visualization
Created the following visualizations:
- **Line Chart**: Showing trends over time (e.g., sales over a period).
- **Bar Chart**: Comparing the average sales per region.
- **Histogram**: Showing the distribution of sales data.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualizing the relationship between sales and date.

## Files Included
- **`sales_data_analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.
- **`README.md`**: This file, containing the project description.
