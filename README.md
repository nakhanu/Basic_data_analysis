Data Analysis and Visualization Assignment
Overview
This project involves loading and analyzing a dataset using the pandas library in Python and creating visualizations using the matplotlib library. The assignment covers data exploration, analysis, and the creation of simple plots to visualize trends and relationships within the data.

Objectives
To load and analyze a dataset using the pandas library.

To create basic visualizations (line charts, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots) to represent the data.

To compute and analyze basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.

To explore relationships between variables and identify trends in the data.

Dataset
For this assignment, I have used a manually created dataset that contains information about sales data. The dataset includes columns such as:

Product: Name of the product.

Sales: The sales figures for the product.

Region: The region where the product was sold.

Date: Date when the sale occurred.

Steps Completed
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Explored the data using .head() to display the first few rows.

Checked for missing values and cleaned the data by handling them appropriately.

2. Basic Data Analysis
Calculated basic statistics for numerical columns (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation).

Grouped the data by the Region column to compute the mean sales for each region.

3. Data Visualization
Created four types of visualizations:

Line Chart: Showing trends over time (e.g., sales over a period).

Bar Chart: Comparing the average sales per region.

Histogram: Showing the distribution of sales data.

Scatter Plot: Visualizing the relationship between sales and date.

Files Included
sales_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the data analysis and visualizations.

README.md: This file, containing the project description.

Installation
Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

You can install them using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Running the Notebook
Clone the repository or download the .ipynb file.

Open the notebook in your Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code).

Run each cell in the notebook to execute the data analysis and view the visualizations.

Findings and Observations
(Here, you can add any insights or interesting findings from your analysis. For example: "The sales data showed a significant increase in Q4 for Region A, which could be due to seasonal demand.")

(You can mention any trends or relationships observed between the variables, e.g., "Sales are positively correlated with the region-specific campaigns.")
